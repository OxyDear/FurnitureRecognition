Share Link copied! Post Share Pin it Shipping & Returns How long does shipping and delivery take? In the Portland metro area, our lead time is 12 to 14 weeks. For the rest of the continental United States, lead times will include 2 to 4 additional weeks for shipping. Due to current supply chain challenges, please note that the lead time(s) provided at the time of sale are a representation of our understanding, in the moment, of the furniture or component part’s future availability. Lead times are subject to change and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. We will keep you advised of any delays that arise as the information is received. Can I pick my furniture up? We offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as \"in good condition\" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released. What if my furniture doesn't fit? The customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited. Additional shipping and delivery charges will apply to orders that use store credit.

It has an inlaid dark brown leather writing surface, two drawers and a cable access hole to each side at the rear of the desk. This item requires basic assembly or can be delivered white glove including assembly. Dimensions Metric Imperial Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Dimension drawing Materials and finishes Black American walnut Black walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. European oak European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. Dark brown house leather Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. Care guide Oiled wood An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. • Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. • To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains: • As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: • Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) • Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. Lacquered wood A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: • Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. • Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. House leather Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. Click + Collect Click + Collect Flat Rate Delivery Flat Rate Delivery Ways to Pay Ways to Pay Key Features - Mango Timber The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Product Care - Timber Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax , oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.
